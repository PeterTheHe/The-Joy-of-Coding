# Introduction

We make computers do stuff by telling them to do stuff. We tell them to do stuff by feeding them code. This code is then interpreted by the computer and the computer executes its orders no questions asked (most of the time). In light of this, we than think of a computer as a mathematically gifted five-year-old who speaks in some secret language.

## The Language

### Saying "Oioi"

Our metaphorical five-year-old can now do a bunch of cool things. Let's imagine we can make him say things by feeding him a certain piece of code. What would this code look like?

It would probably look something like this:

`say "oioi world"`
