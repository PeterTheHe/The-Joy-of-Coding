# Preface

Some time ago a dude at the top of a certain unnamed coorporation decided that his workers, given what they were being paid, weren't producing enough stuff. He thus decided to cybernetically enhance his workers by equipping them with glroified calculators strapped to fat-screen displays. Productivity boomed, the company gained an edge against its competitors and soon the eerie green glow of old cathode ray tube screens was the new black.

Fast forward a couple of decades and glorified calculators (now called **computers**) are everywhere guiding planes, missiles into planes, the task force sent to investigate the smouldering wreckage and the coffee machines that help to keep the investigators awake. This book will hopefully teach you how to talk to these magnificent (?) machines.

## Who is this book aimed at?

This book is aimed at three very special people aged 13, 13 and 15 with little (ie. the godawful national curriculum)/no experience with computer programming who have somehow ended up invited to pitch their product to the board of Oracle (a very big computer place) in just under two months. The book aims to introduce them to problem solving by the means of *communicating* with computers and other digital things. This is **not** a course in any particular programming language nor is it in any way a course in computer science.

## Preamble

Before we start, here are some random things I'd like you to bear in mind as you work your way through this book.

* Computer Science and Programming / Coding are not the same thing. Computer science is thinking of cool ways to do things with a computers. It usually involves a lot of maths and often involves solving maths problems. Programming/Coding is building things with code. **You can solve problems in computer science without touching a computer**.

* There is so much more to making good software than just the code. Making sure that code is readable and well-documented is super important as projects grow in scale. Teamwork and management are super important too, as are UX and good market research. I shit you not, as you'll see quite soon, **the code is the easy part**.

* As with real life, there are many ways to solve the same problem in computer science, some faster than others. Say you're searching for a book in a library. One method you can employ is going to the section your book is in (be it adult fiction, cookery, erotica...) and then searching alphabetically. Another method you can employ is randomly wandering around until you find the book. Both methods are valid but one will probably find the book first (unless the other gets lucky).

* With computers there's a very fine line between what is possible and what isn't. Scoping is important and your ability to do so grows with experience - don't worry too much about it now.

* And finally, always remember that **computers are just tools** - like a hammer or screwdriver, they make things easier but they aren't the only ones in existence...
